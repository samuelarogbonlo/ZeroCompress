# ZeroCompress

An advanced compression framework optimized for Ethereum L2 rollup data.

## Overview

ZeroCompress aims to significantly reduce data requirements for Ethereum L2 rollups through specialized compression techniques, potentially reducing costs by 50-80% and increasing throughput. This project bridges theoretical compression methods with production-ready implementations that L2 networks can easily adopt.

Based on research by Vitalik Buterin and inspired by successful implementations like Sequence.xyz's CZIP, ZeroCompress provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and optimizing calldata on Ethereum L2 networks.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Data Analysis**: Tools for collecting and analyzing transaction data from major L2 networks
- **Compression Techniques**: Implementation of various compression methods:
  - Zero-byte elimination
  - Address compression
  - Function signature optimization
  - Calldata structure optimization
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Framework for measuring compression ratios and computational overhead
- **Integration Adapters**: Modules designed for easy integration with different L2 architectures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 16+ (for JavaScript components)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZeroCompress.git
   cd ZeroCompress
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r tools/data-collection/requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Data Analysis Tools

The data analysis toolkit helps identify compression opportunities in L2 transaction data:

```
cd tools/data-collection
python scripts/run_analysis.py --network arbitrum --blocks 100 --max-txs 10000
```

This will:
1. Collect transaction data from Arbitrum
2. Analyze address patterns, zero-byte patterns, and calldata structures
3. Generate a comprehensive report with compression potential estimates

## Compression Techniques

ZeroCompress focuses on these key compression methods:

1. **Zero-byte Compression**: Replace sequences of zero bytes with compressed representations
2. **Address Compression**: Replace 20-byte addresses with smaller indices
3. **Function Signature Optimization**: Encode common function signatures more efficiently
4. **Calldata Pattern Recognition**: Identify and compress repeated patterns in transaction data

## Research

The `research/` directory contains detailed analysis of existing compression implementations, architecture specifications, and theoretical compression limits. Key findings include:

- Current L2 networks show 30-60% potential compression opportunity
- Address compression alone can reduce data requirements by 15-25%
- Zero-byte elimination offers 10-20% data reduction for typical transactions
