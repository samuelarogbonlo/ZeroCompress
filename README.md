# ZeroCompress

Advanced compression framework for Ethereum L2 rollups, targeting 75%+ data reduction with minimal computational overhead.

## 🚀 Project Overview

ZeroCompress aims to create an advanced compression framework specifically optimized for rollup data on Ethereum. As noted by Vitalik Buterin, current rollups use basic compression techniques, while optimized compression could potentially reduce data requirements from ~180 bytes per transaction to under 25 bytes.

Our analysis of 1,000,000 transactions demonstrates a potential **72.93% compression ratio**, which would translate directly to gas cost savings for L2 users. This is substantially better than existing implementations like Sequence.xyz which achieve ~50% savings.

> ⚠️ **Current Status**: Phase 1 research with working prototype implementation. Not yet production-ready.

## 📊 Key Findings

Through our extensive data analysis of 1M realistic transactions:

- **Overall compression potential: 72.93%**
- **Zero-byte compression: 33.13%**
- **Address compression: 59.52%**

Different transaction types show varying compression potential:
- Uniswap swaps: 45.90% zero bytes, 32.13% potential savings
- ERC20 transferFrom: 44.61% zero bytes, 31.23% potential savings
- ERC20 approve: 40.49% zero bytes, 28.34% potential savings
- ERC20 transfers: 39.96% zero bytes, 27.97% potential savings
- Contract deployments: 40.23% zero bytes, 28.16% potential savings
- Contract interactions: 35.04% zero bytes, 24.53% potential savings

## 💪 Advantages Over Other Solutions

ZeroCompress has the potential to surpass existing solutions for several key reasons:

1. **Higher Compression Ratio**: Our analysis shows 72.93% potential compression versus Sequence's ~50% in production.

2. **Multi-technique Integration**: We combine four advanced techniques:
   - Zero-byte elimination
   - Address compression
   - Function selector optimization
   - Calldata pattern recognition

3. **Transaction-type Optimization**: By optimizing for specific transaction types with high compression potential, we achieve better results than one-size-fits-all approaches.

4. **Data-driven Design**: Our million-transaction analysis provides optimization insights that other implementations miss.

5. **Modular Architecture**: Our design allows selective application of techniques based on transaction characteristics.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

ZeroCompress employs a layered compression approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           ZeroCompressor                │
│  (Orchestrates multiple techniques)     │
├─────────┬──────────┬─────────┬─────────┤
│ Address │ Zero-Byte│ Function│ Calldata│
│ Compr.  │ Compr.   │ Select. │ Pattern │
└─────────┴──────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

### Components:

- **AddressCompressor**: Compresses 20-byte addresses using dictionary-based lookup (up to 80% savings)
- **ZeroByteCompressor**: Uses run-length encoding for zero byte sequences (up to 33% savings)
- **FunctionSelectorCompressor**: Optimizes 4-byte function selectors to 1-byte indices
- **CalldataCompressor**: Identifies and compresses repeated patterns in calldata
- **ZeroCompressor**: Main orchestrator that combines all techniques

## 📈 Current Progress

We're currently in **Phase 1** of development, having completed:

- ✅ Comprehensive research on existing compression techniques
- ✅ Detailed architecture design with component and sequence diagrams
- ✅ Data collection and pattern analysis (1M transactions)
- ✅ Implementation of core compression modules
- 🔄 In progress: Theoretical compression limit analysis

Next phases will include:
- Benchmarking framework
- On-chain decompression contracts
- Integration with major rollups
- Security auditing

## 🧪 Creating a Test Environment

To try the ZeroCompress prototype:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r src/requirements.txt

# Run the example script
cd src
python -m examples.compression_example
```

## 🏆 Performance Goals

Our target metrics for the final implementation:
- 75%+ compression ratio (vs. Sequence's 50%)
- Lower decompression gas costs than existing solutions
- Support for all major L2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.)
- Seamless integration path for rollup providers

## 🛠️ Future Work

- Benchmarking against Sequence.xyz and other implementations
- Gas optimization for on-chain decompression
- Protocol-specific adapter modules
- Security verification and formal proofs
- EIP proposal for standardized compression
